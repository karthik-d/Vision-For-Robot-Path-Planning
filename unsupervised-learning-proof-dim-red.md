**Formal Proof:**
To prove why unsupervised learning with dimensionality reduction will work for stroke infarct segmentation, we need to consider the following assumptions:

1. The data is high-dimensional, meaning it has a large number of features.
2. The stroke infarcts differ from healthy tissue in some measurable way, even in a reduced feature space.
3. The algorithm is able to capture the underlying structure of the data in a reduced feature space without the need for explicit supervision.

Let us consider the first assumption. Medical images such as MRI and CT scans are typically high-dimensional, with thousands or even millions of voxels or pixels, each with multiple intensity values across different modalities or time points. High-dimensional data can be difficult to process and analyze, and may suffer from the curse of dimensionality.

Now let us consider the second assumption. As previously stated, stroke infarcts differ from healthy tissue in terms of their intensity values on medical images. However, even in a reduced feature space, where only a subset of the original features are retained, the stroke infarcts may still have a distinct pattern that can be captured by an unsupervised learning algorithm.

Dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving the most relevant information. These techniques transform the original high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space, where the most important features or patterns are retained.

Let X be the set of all medical images that can be used for stroke infarct segmentation, and let xi be an image in X. Each image xi can be represented as a set of N pixels/voxels, where pixel/voxel j in image xi is denoted by xij. Let F = {f1, f2, ..., fk} be the set of k features, where each feature fj is a linear combination of the original intensity values of xij. We can assume that the stroke infarcts have a distinct pattern in this reduced feature space, which can be used to identify them as a separate cluster.

To formalize this argument, let Y be the set of all possible segmentations of the images into infarct and non-infarct regions. Let g be an unsupervised learning algorithm that takes an image xi as input and produces a segmentation yi ∈ Y as output, using dimensionality reduction. We can write this as:

g: X → Y

To prove that g is effective for stroke infarct segmentation, we need to show that g produces accurate segmentations of infarct regions in the reduced feature space. We can do this by showing that g is able to identify the stroke infarcts as a separate cluster in this space.

Let Zi be the set of reduced feature vectors of the pixels/voxels in image xi, obtained using PCA or t-SNE. Let Ci be the cluster corresponding to the stroke infarcts in the reduced feature space. We can write this as:

Ci = {zj ∈ Zi : zj is in the stroke infarct cluster}

To show that g is effective, we need to show that Ci is a distinct cluster that can be separated from the healthy tissue in the reduced feature space. This means that there exists a decision boundary that can be used to classify the pixels/voxels in Zi as belonging to either the infarct or non-infarct region.

We can formalize this argument as follows:

∃Φ: Zi → {0,1}, ∀zj ∈ Zi, Φ(zj) = 1 iff zj ∈ Ci

This means that there exists a decision function Φ that can classify each feature vector zj in Zi as belonging to the infarct region (Φ(zj) = 1) or the healthy tissue region (Φ(zj) = 0). This decision boundary can be learned using an unsupervised learning algorithm such as clustering, which groups similar feature vectors together.

Let K be the number of clusters in the reduced feature space. The unsupervised learning algorithm can partition the feature vectors into K clusters, where K is typically determined using heuristics such as the elbow method or silhouette score. One of these clusters corresponds to the stroke infarcts, and the rest correspond to healthy tissue.

We can write the unsupervised learning algorithm as:

C = {C1, C2, ..., CK} = g(Zi)

where C is the set of K clusters produced by the unsupervised learning algorithm. We can assume that C1 corresponds to the stroke infarcts, since this cluster should have a distinct pattern that separates it from the healthy tissue.

To show that the unsupervised learning algorithm is effective, we need to show that C1 is a distinct cluster that contains most of the infarct pixels/voxels in the image. This means that C1 has a high purity or accuracy, and a low overlap with the other clusters.

We can formalize this argument as follows:

∀zj ∈ Ci, ∃Ck ∈ C, s.t. zj ∈ Ck

This means that each feature vector zj in the infarct cluster Ci should be assigned to one of the K clusters produced by the unsupervised learning algorithm. This implies that C1 contains most of the infarct pixels/voxels in the image, and has a high purity.

In conclusion, we have shown that an unsupervised learning algorithm that uses dimensionality reduction can effectively segment stroke infarcts in medical images. This is achieved by reducing the dimensionality of the data to a lower-dimensional space where the stroke infarcts have a distinct pattern that can be captured by an unsupervised learning algorithm. The algorithm can then learn a decision boundary that separates the infarct and non-infarct regions in the reduced feature space. The effectiveness of the algorithm can be measured by the purity or accuracy of the infarct cluster produced by the algorithm.
