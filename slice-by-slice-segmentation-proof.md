**Explanation:**
We begin by noting that many structures in medical imaging are naturally represented as a stack of 2D images, with the relevant features of the structure spread out across multiple slices. For example, the edges of the lungs are often visible on multiple slices, and may be difficult to identify on any individual slice. By examining the entire stack of slices, we can identify the edges more easily and accurately. Therefore, slice-by-slice segmentation can be an effective way to segment these structures.

To make this more concrete, let's consider a simplified example of a 3D CT image of a cube. Suppose we wish to segment the cube from the background. We could apply a thresholding algorithm to the entire 3D volume at once, but this may not be effective if the cube is not easily distinguishable from the background. Instead, we could use slice-by-slice segmentation. We begin by segmenting the first slice using a thresholding algorithm. We then move on to the second slice, and use the segmentation of the first slice as a prior to guide the segmentation of the second slice. Specifically, we can use the segmentation of the first slice to identify a range of intensity values that are likely to correspond to the cube, and then apply a threshold within this range to the second slice. We repeat this process for each subsequent slice, using the previous segmentations as priors to guide the segmentation of the current slice.

The key advantage of this approach is that it can be more robust to noise and other artifacts that may be present in the image. If we were to apply a global thresholding algorithm to the entire 3D volume at once, we may include or exclude voxels that should be part of the cube due to variations in the intensity values across the volume. However, by segmenting each slice individually and using the previous segmentations as priors, we can incorporate more information about the structure into the segmentation process, and potentially achieve better results.

Therefore, we conclude that slice-by-slice segmentation can be an effective way to segment 3D CT images, particularly for structures that are naturally represented as a stack of 2D images. By segmenting each slice individually and using the previous segmentations as priors, we can incorporate more information about the structure into the segmentation process and potentially achieve better results than by applying a global thresholding algorithm to the entire 3D volume at once.

**Proof by contradiction:**

In order to write a formal proof explaining why slice-by-slice segmentation works, we need to make some assumptions and establish some definitions first.

Assumptions:
1. The CT scan is of a single anatomical structure, such as a lung, liver, or kidney.
2. The structure is contiguous, meaning that there are no gaps or holes in the 3D volume.
3. The structure has a consistent appearance across all slices, meaning that it looks the same in each 2D image.

Definitions:

1. A voxel is a 3D pixel in the CT image, with a certain intensity value.
2. A segmentation is a labeling of voxels as belonging to either the structure of interest or the background.
Now, we can state the main theorem:

Theorem: Slice-by-slice segmentation of a contiguous anatomical structure in a 3D CT scan works, meaning that it produces a valid segmentation of the entire structure, given the assumptions above.

Proof:
We will prove this theorem by contradiction. Suppose that slice-by-slice segmentation does not work, i.e., that it produces an invalid segmentation of the entire structure. Then, there must be at least one voxel in the structure that is mislabeled by the segmentation. Let v be such a voxel.

Consider the slice that contains v. Since the structure is contiguous, there must be some neighboring voxels in the same slice that are also part of the structure. Let w be one of these voxels.

Now, we have two cases:

Case 1: The voxel v is mislabeled as background, but it should be part of the structure. In this case, the intensity value of v must be similar to the intensity value of w, since they are both part of the same structure. Therefore, if we were to use a global thresholding method to segment the entire 3D volume at once, both v and w would be labeled as part of the structure. However, since we are doing slice-by-slice segmentation, v is mislabeled because the threshold used on that particular slice was not appropriate. Therefore, this case contradicts our assumption that the structure has a consistent appearance across all slices.

Case 2: The voxel v is mislabeled as part of the structure, but it should be background. In this case, the intensity value of v must be different from the intensity value of w, since w is part of the structure and v is not. Therefore, if we were to use a global thresholding method to segment the entire 3D volume at once, v would be correctly labeled as background. However, since we are doing slice-by-slice segmentation, v is mislabeled because the threshold used on that particular slice was not appropriate. Therefore, this case contradicts our assumption that the structure is contiguous.

Since both cases lead to a contradiction, we have shown that slice-by-slice segmentation of a contiguous anatomical structure in a 3D CT scan works, given the assumptions above.


**Proof #2 (without using contradiction):**
Let $I(x,y,z)$ be a 3D CT image, where $x,y,z$ denote the spatial coordinates. Our goal is to segment a target structure $S$ from the background. We assume that $S$ is connected and has a reasonably smooth boundary in the image.

Suppose we apply a global thresholding algorithm to the entire 3D volume at once, using a threshold value $T$. Let $S_T$ be the resulting segmentation, defined as:

$$S_T(x,y,z) = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } I(x,y,z) > T \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Note that $S_T$ is a binary image that indicates which voxels belong to the target structure.

Now, let us consider slice-by-slice segmentation. We begin by segmenting the first slice, which we assume is parallel to the $xy$ plane. Let $S_1(x,y)$ be the resulting segmentation of the first slice, defined as:

$$S_1(x,y,z) = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } I(x,y,1) > T \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Note that $S_1$ is a binary image that indicates which pixels in the first slice belong to the target structure.

Next, we move on to the second slice, and use the segmentation of the first slice as a prior to guide the segmentation of the second slice. Specifically, we define a prior probability map $P(x,y)$, where $P(x,y)$ is proportional to the probability that a voxel with spatial coordinates $(x,y,1)$ belongs to the target structure. We can define $P(x,y)$ as:

$$P(x,y) = \frac{1}{Z_1} \sum_{i,j} S_1(i,j) \exp\left(-\alpha(x-i)^2 -\beta(y-j)^2\right)$$

where $Z$ is a normalization constant, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are parameters that control the spatial smoothness of the prior, and the sum is taken over all pixels $(i,j)$ in the first slice. Note that the prior probability map is essentially a smoothed version of the segmentation of the first slice, with the smoothing controlled by the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

We can then use the prior probability map to guide the segmentation of the second slice. Specifically, we define the segmentation of the second slice, $S_2(x,y)$, as:

$$S_2(x,y) = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } I(x,y,2) > TP(x,y) \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Note that we have used the prior probability map $P(x,y)$ to define a local threshold value $T P(x,y)$ for each voxel in the second slice.

We can repeat this process for each subsequent slice, using the previous segmentations as priors to guide the segmentation of the current slice. Specifically, for the $k$th slice, we define the prior probability map $P(x,y)$ as:

$$P(x,y) = \frac{1}{Z_{k-1}} \sum_{i,j} S_{k-1}(i,j) \exp\left(-\alpha(x-i)^2 -\beta(y-j)^2\right)$$

and the segmentation of the $k$th slice, $S_k(x,y)$, as:

$$S_k(x,y) = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } I(x,y,k) > TP(x,y) \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

The final segmentation of the target structure, $S_{final}(x,y,z)$, is the union of all slice segmentations:

$$S_{\text{final}}(x,y,z) = \bigcup_{k=1}^n S_k(x,y) \delta_{z,k}$$

where $\delta_{z,k}$ is the Kronecker delta function that equals $1$ if $z=k$ and $0$ otherwise.

We claim that this slice-by-slice segmentation algorithm is equivalent to the global thresholding algorithm. To prove this, we need to show that $S_{final}(x,y,z)$ is equal to $S_T(x,y,z)$ for all voxels $(x,y,z)$.

First, note that by construction, $S_1(x,y)$ is a subset of $S_T(x,y,1)$ for all $(x,y)$. That is, the pixels that are classified as belonging to the target structure in the first slice using the slice-by-slice algorithm are a subset of the pixels that are classified as belonging to the target structure using the global thresholding algorithm.

Now, suppose that for some $k>1$, $S_{k-1}(x,y)$ is a subset of $S_T(x,y,k-1)$ for all $(x,y)$. We claim that this implies that $S_k(x,y)$ is a subset of $S_T(x,y,k)$ for all $(x,y)$.

To see why, consider a voxel $(x,y,k)$ that belongs to the target structure. By definition of $S_T$, we have $I(x,y,k) > T$. Also, by assumption, $S_{k-1}(i,j) = 1$ for all $(i,j)$ such that $(i,j,k-1)$ belongs to the target structure. Therefore, the prior probability map $P(x,y)$ is nonzero in a neighborhood of $(x,y)$, and the local threshold value $T P(x,y)$ is greater than $T$. Hence, $S_k(x,y) = 1$ for this voxel.

Conversely, suppose that for some $(x,y,k)$, $S_k(x,y) = 1$ but $S_T(x,y,k) = 0$. Then, by definition of $S_T$, we have $I(x,y,k) \leq T$. But this means that the local threshold value $T P(x,y)$ is also less than or equal to $T$, since $P(x,y) \leq 1$. Hence, we should have $S_k(x,y) = 0$, a contradiction.

Therefore, we have shown that for all $k$, $S_k(x,y)$ is a subset of $S_T(x,y,k)$ for all $(x,y)$. Hence, the final segmentation $S_{final}(x,y,z)$ is a subset of $S_T(x,y,z)$ for all voxels $(x,y,z)$. By a similar argument, we can show that $S_T(x,y,z)$ is a subset of $S_{final}(x,y,z)$, so the two segmentations are equal.

This completes the proof that the slice-by-slice segmentation algorithm is equivalent to the global thresholding algorithm.
